         Today marks the day you graced this world with your captivating beauty intellect and eventually my life. I know our relationship didn't
         start of the best and we've had our own patches to deal with but I know for a fact that we would turn out beautiful because
         with hardship comes ease. 
         Enjoy your day LOVE.
